# online-grocery-store
The  online grocery website is a fully responsive frontend grocery shopping application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can browse products, search, filter by categories, add items to cart, modify quantities, and view dynamic totals. The cart state is saved using localStorage, making the app behave like a real e-commerce platform.
